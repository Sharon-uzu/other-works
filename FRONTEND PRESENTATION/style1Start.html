            <h2>CSS INTRODUCTION </h2>
            <h3>CSS Meaning</h3>
            <span>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
            </span>

            <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
            <span>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. <br>


                <ul>
                    <li>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</li> 

                    <li>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. 
        
                        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. 
        
                        Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</li> 

                </ul>

            </span>

            <h2 style="font-size: 46px; margin-top: 30px;">Methods Of Styling in CSS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Inline Styling</li>
                <li>Internal Styling</li>
                <li>External Styling</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: rgb(71, 165, 134);">INLINE STYLING</h3>
            <SPAN>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element. Inline CSS styles are included within the HTML document and are specific to individual HTML elements, allowing for targeted styling.</SPAN>


            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: rgb(71, 165, 134);">INTERNAL STYLING</h3>
            <SPAN>Inline CSS styles are included within the HTML document and are specific to individual HTML elements, allowing for targeted styling. Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add a < style> tag in the < head> section of your HTML document.</SPAN>


            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: rgb(71, 165, 134);">EXTERNAL STYLING</h3>
            <SPAN>External CSS styles are stored in a separate file and can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for global styling across an entire website. With external CSS, youâ€™ll link your web pages to an external .css file.</SPAN>
