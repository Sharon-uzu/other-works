        <h2>HTML ELEMENTS</h2>

            <p>HTML element is a component of HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document.</p>
            <p>An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.</p>
            <p>HTML element is often — but not always — created by opening and closing HTML tags, which wrap around a piece of content. Below is an illustration that labels each of the parts of an HTML element:</p>
            <img src="images/sample.jpeg" alt="">

            <h3>Most HTML elements consist of three parts:</h3>

               <p><span>1. The opening tag (or start tag):</span> This marks where the element’s content begins</p> 
                
               <p><span>2.The closing tag (or end tag):</span> This marks the end of the element’s content. The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (/) after the first angle bracket.</p>
                
               <p><span>3. The content:</span> This is placed between the element’s opening and closing tags</p><br><br>


               <h3>NESTED ELEMENTS</h3>
                    <p>Most HTML elements can contain any number of further elements (except empty elements), which are, in turn, made up of tags, attributes, and content or other elements. <br>
                    Example: <br>
                    < p>Here is some < b>bold< /b> text.< /p><br><br>
                    < ol> <br>
                                < li>Bag< /li> <br>
                                < li>Shoes< /li> <br>
                            < /ol>
                    </p>

               <h3>VOID ELEMENT</h3>
               <P>Void element: All the elements in HTML do not require to have start tag and end tag, some elements does not have content and end tag such elements are known as Void elements or empty elements. These elements are also called as unpaired tag.</P>
               <p>Self-closing tags in HTML are sometimes also known as empty tags, void tags, singletons tags, etc. This means that these tags have no content and cannot have any children.</p>

                <h3>SELF CLOSING TAGS</h3>
               <P>A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag as </tag>. Some few self-closing tags are <input/>, <hr/>, <br/>, <img/>, etc.

                </P>

                


                    <h3>CATERGORIES OF HTML ELEMENTS</h3>
                    <p>For the default display and styling purpose in HTML, all the elements are divided into two categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Block-level element
                        <li>Inline element</li>
                        </li>
                    </ol><br>

                    

                    <p><span>Block-level element</span> A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p><br>

                    <p>Following are the block-level elements in HTML. <br>

                        < address>, < article>, < aside>, < blockquote>, < dd>, < div>, < figure>, < footer>, < form>, < h1>-< h6>, < header>, < hr>, < li>, < main>, < nav>, < ol>, < output>, < p>, < pre>, < section>, < table>, < tfoot>, < ul>, < video> etc.</p><br><br>


                    <p><span>Inline elements</span> are those elements, which differentiate the part of a given text and provide it a particular function.</p>
                    <p>These elements does not start with new line and take width as per requirement. The Inline elements are mostly used with other elements. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. </p>

                    <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
                    <p>< a>,  < b>, < big>, < br>, < button>, < cite>, < em>, < i>, < img>, < input>, < label>, < select>, < small>, < span>, < strong>, < sub>, < sup> , < textarea> etc.</p><br><br>

                   
                    <h3>HTML Formatting Elements</h3>
                    <p>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text. Most inline are formatting elements.</p>

                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <p><span>< b></span> - Bold text
                    <p><span>< strong></span> - Important text
                    <p><span>< i></span> - Italic text
                    <p><span>< em></span> - Emphasized text
                    <p><span>< mark></span> - Marked text
                    <p><span>< small></span> - Smaller text
                    <p><span>< del></span> - Deleted text
                    <p><span>< sub></span> - Subscript text
                    <p><span>< sup></span> - Superscript text</p>
